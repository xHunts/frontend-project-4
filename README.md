## Web Application Description 
xHunt is an online platform for travellers and adventure seekers looking for new experiences. It shows you the world through scavenger hunting, where every scavenger hunt we create is designed to show people the best-known landmarks as well as the hidden gems of different locations.

Users will need to use the xHunt application which will include a tracker, for us to know where the players are and how they are progressing. It will also be used as the main source of communication, where they will receive messages, hints and support throughout their journey.

To make the experience more exciting, each scavenger hunt will take place in a different period of time depending on the best time to visit a certain location, as well as weather, festivals, crowd and so on. Each year, the hunts will be re-designed it different ways. xHunt will have a logistics partner in every location it operates in, which will take care of customer experience and services including emergencies. 

xHunt aims to reach the public through digital marketing, launching videos and advertisements on social media channels to increase the platform visibility. xHunt also aims to approach travel influencers to market the platform. xHunt also plans to use Paid Search and advertisements through print media and hoardings which could potentially increase the visibility of the platform and make it known to the world by making the information get to the top of the first page on search engines. Target customers include adventure seekers and frequent travellers.
